Description: A tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from files called `Makefile.am'.

 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back of the Automake maintainer).

 .

 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions (with rules being thrown in occasionally). The generated `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.

 .

 Automake 1.11 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 did, so has been renamed so that the previous version can continue to be made available.

 .

  * Automatic format detection. Libarchive automatically detects the compression (none/gzip/bzip2) and format (old tar, ustar, gnutar, pax, cpio, iso9660, zip) when reading archives. It does this for any data source.

 .

  * Pax Interchange Format Support. This is a POSIX/SUSv3 extension to the old "ustar" tar format that adds arbitrary extended attributes to each entry. Does everything that GNU tar format does, only better.

 .

  * Handles file flags, ACLs, arbitrary pathnames, etc. Pax interchange format supports key/value attributes using an easily-extensible technique. Arbitrary pathnames, group names, user names, file sizes are part of the POSIX standard; libarchive extends this with support for file flags, ACLs, and arbitrary device numbers.

 .

  * GNU tar support. Libarchive reads most GNU tar archives. If there is demand, this can be improved further.

  * Library. Since the core functionality is in a library, it can be used by other tools, such as pkg_add.

 .

  * Automatic format detection. Libarchive automatically detects the compression (none/gzip/bzip2) and format (old tar, ustar, gnutar, pax, cpio, iso9660, zip) when reading archives. It does this for any data source.

 .

  * Pax Interchange Format Support. This is a POSIX/SUSv3 extension to the old "ustar" tar format that adds arbitrary extended attributes to each entry. Does everything that GNU tar format does, only better.

 .

  * Handles file flags, ACLs, arbitrary pathnames, etc. Pax interchange format supports key/value attributes using an easily-extensible technique. Arbitrary pathnames, group names, user names, file sizes are part of the POSIX standard; libarchive extends this with support for file flags, ACLs, and arbitrary device numbers.

 .

  * GNU tar support. Libarchive reads most GNU tar archives. If there is demand, this can be improved further.

Description: Tiny utilities for small and embedded systems
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv, mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts.

 .

 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd, busybox-udhcpc or busybox-udhcpd packages.

Description: High-quality block-sorting file compressor - utilities
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression.

 .

 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

 .

 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its predecessor, bzip (.bz).

 principles, but does everything in the frequency domain, which removes some of

 the limitations of CELP. CELT is suitable for both speech and music and

 currently features:

 .

  * Ultra-low latency (typically from 3 to 9 ms)

  * Full audio bandwidth (44.1 kHz and 48 kHz)

  * Stereo support

  * Packet loss concealment

  * Constant bit-rates from 32 kbps to 128 kbps and above

  * A fixed-point version of the encoder and decoder

 .

 The CELT codec is meant to close the gap between Vorbis and Speex for

 applications where both high quality audio and low delay are desired.

 .

 This package provides the celtenc and celtdec command line tools for encoding

 and decoding.

Priority: optional
Description: simple interprocess messaging system
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.

 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 terms of complexity.

 .

 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus

 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be

 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using

 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but

 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.

 .

 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

 .

 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.

 .

 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no

 longer contained in this package.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.

 .

 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file

 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where

 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that

 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences

 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.

 .

 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute

 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.

 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared

 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can

 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the command line or in scripts. Even if you don't want to use it, other packages on your system probably will.

 .

 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west". GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to look at every character. The result is typically many times faster than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing will run more slowly, however.)

Description: Java virtual machine for the CLI
 IKVM.NET is a free implementation of Java for the Common Language

 Infrastructure like Mono and the Microsoft .NET Framework.

 .

 There are two main ways of using IKVM.NET:

  - Dynamically:

    In this mode, Java classes and jars are used directly to execute Java

    applications on the CLI runtime.

    Java bytecode is translated on the fly into Common Intermediate Language

    by running on the IKVM.NET runtime.

    The full Java class loader model is supported in this mode.

  - Statically:

    In order to allow Java code to be used by CLI applications, it must be

    compiled down to an assembly and used directly.

    The Java bytecode is translated to CIL and is stored in this form. The

    assemblies can be referenced and used directly by the CLI applications

    by only using the CLI runtime.

    While the static mode does not support the full Java class loader

    mechanism, it is possible for statically compiled code to create a class

    loader and load classes dynamically.

Priority: optional
Description: Single library to read/write tar, cpio, pax, zip, iso9660, etc.
 The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and

 writing streaming archive files such as tar and cpio.  The library is

 inherently stream-oriented; readers serially iterate through the archive,

 writers serially add things to the archive.  In particular, note that

 there is no built-in support for random access nor for in-place

 modification.

 .

 libarchive can read at least five tar formats, four cpio formats,

 ISO9660 CD/DVD images (including RockRidge extensions), and ZIP

 files.

 .

 libarchive can write two tar formats (ustar and pax), one cpio format

 (odc/POSIX), and two types of shar files (with and without uuencoding).

 .

 The bsdtar Debian package, which is the default tar(1) on FreeBSD,

 is built using libarchive.

 .

 There is also a manpage, tar(5), that provides an excellent description

 of the various tar file formats.

 ASM is an all purpose Java bytecode manipulation and analysis framework.

 It can be used to modify existing classes or dynamically generate classes,

 directly in binary form. Provided common transformations and analysis

 algorithms allow one to easily assemble custom complex transformations

 and code analysis tools.

 .

 ASM offer similar functionality as other bytecode frameworks, but it is

 focused on simplicity of use and performance. Because it was designed and

 implemented to be as small and as fast as possible, it makes it very

 attractive for using in dynamic systems.

Description: Java bytecode manipulation framework
 It can be used to dynamically generate stub classes or other proxy classes,

 directly in binary form, or to dynamically modify classes at load time, i.e.,

 just before they are loaded into the Java Virtual Machine.

 .

 ASM offers similar functionalities as BCEL or SERP, but is much smaller

 (25KB instead of 350KB for BCEL and 150KB for SERP) and faster

 than these tools (the overhead of a load time class transformation is on

 the order of 60% with ASM, 700% or more with BCEL, and 1100% or more with

 SERP). ASM was designed to be used in a dynamic and static way and was

 therefore designed and implemented to be as small and as fast as possible.

Description: Analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files
 The Byte Code Engineering Library is intended to give users a convenient

 possibility to analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files

 (those ending with .class). Classes are represented by objects which contain

 all the symbolic information of the given class: methods, fields and byte

 code instructions, in particular.

 .

 Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed by a program

 (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to a file again. An even more

 interesting application is the creation of classes from scratch at run-time.

 The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be also useful if you want to

 learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class

 files.

 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.

 Boost.Atomic is a library that provides atomic data types and

 operations on these data types, as well as memory ordering

 constraints required for coordinating multiple threads through atomic

 variables. It implements the interface as defined by the C++11

 standard, but makes this feature available for platforms lacking

 system/compiler support for this particular C++11 feature.

 .

 Users of this library should already be familiar with concurrency in

 general, as well as elementary concepts such as "mutual exclusion".

 .

 The implementation makes use of processor-specific instructions where

 possible (via inline assembler, platform libraries or compiler

 intrinsics), and falls back to "emulating" atomic operations through

 locking.

 Boost.Container is a foundational library that provides a sort of

 cooperative multitasking on a single thread. By providing an

 abstraction of the current execution state in the current thread,

 including the stack (with local variables) and stack pointer, all

 registers and CPU flags, and the instruction pointer, a fcontext_t

 instance represents a specific point in the application's execution

 path. This is useful for building higher-level abstractions, like

 coroutines, cooperative threads (userland threads) or an equivalent

 to C# keyword yield in C++.

 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular

 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not

 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope

 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a

Description: Bean Scripting Framework to support scripting languages in Java
 Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides

 scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java

 objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write JSPs in

 languages other than Java while providing access to the Java class library. In

 addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in part (or

 dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. This is

 achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language engines

 from within Java, as well as an object registry that exposes Java objects to

 these scripting language engines.

 .

 BSF supports these scripting languages:

  * Python (using Jython)

  * JavaScript (using rhino)

  * XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and Xerces)

  * BeanShell (using bsh) via its own bsf adapter

 .

 Support for Tcl, NetRexx is not available in this Debian

 .

 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

 .

 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: The CELT codec runtime library
 CELT is an experimental audio codec for use in low-delay communication.

 .

 CELT stands for "Code-Excited Lapped Transform". It applies some of the CELP

 principles, but does everything in the frequency domain, which removes some of

 the limitations of CELP. CELT is suitable for both speech and music and

 currently features:

 .

  * Ultra-low latency (typically from 3 to 9 ms)

  * Full audio bandwidth (44.1 kHz and 48 kHz)

  * Stereo support

  * Packet loss concealment

  * Constant bit-rates from 32 kbps to 128 kbps and above

  * A fixed-point version of the encoder and decoder

 .

 The CELT codec is meant to close the gap between Vorbis and Speex for

 applications where both high quality audio and low delay are desired.

 .

 This package provides the celt runtime library.

Description: internet protocol suite Java library
 This is an Internet protocol suite Java library originally developed by

 ORO, Inc. This version supports Finger, Whois, TFTP, Telnet, POP3, FTP,

 NNTP, SMTP, and some miscellaneous protocols like Time and Echo as well

 as BSD R command support. The purpose of the library is to provide

 fundamental protocol access, not higher-level abstractions. Therefore,

 some of the design violates object-oriented design principles. Our

 philosophy is to make the global functionality of a protocal accesible

 (e.g., TFTP send file and receive file) when possible, but also provide

 access to the fundamental protocols where applicable so that the

 programmer may construct his own custom implementations (e.g, the TFTP

 packet classes and the TFTP packet send and receive methods are

 exposed). NetComponents was originally a commercial product, but after

 ORO dissolved, it was continued to be made available for those who

 found it useful. However, no updates have been made since version

 1.3.8, released in 1998. Now that certain contract obligations have

 expired, it is possible to make the source code freely available under

 the Apache Software License.

Description: lightweight C library for daemons - runtime library
 libdaemon is a leightweight C library which eases the writing of UNIX daemons. It consists of the following parts:

 .

  * Wrapper around fork() for correct daemonization of a process

  * Wrapper around syslog() for simple log output to syslog or STDERR

  * An API for writing PID files

  * An API for serializing signals into a pipe for use with select() or poll()

  * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog

 Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It is not simple to get these done right and code duplication is not acceptable.

 .

 This package includes the libdaemon run time shared library.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications. Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in terms of complexity.

 .

 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.

 .

 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

 .

 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Description: Asynchronous event notification library
 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a

 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs

 on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.

 .

 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in

 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,

 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).

 .

 For backward compatibility and to transition to "libevent_core only"

 or "libevent_core + libevent_extra", the libevent source package builds

 the libevent library that includes everything in libevent_core and

 libevent_extra.

 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a

 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs

 on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.

 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in

 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,

 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).

 .

 The libevent_core library includes event loops, timers, buffer code,

 and various small compatibility functions.

 .

 If you're writing software that only uses libevent's event loop, you

 should link against only the libevent_core library.

Description: Logging library for java
 log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of

 output targets.

 .

 It is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application

 binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements can remain in

 shipped code without incurring a high performance cost.

 .

 One of the distinctive features of log4j is the notion of hierarchical

 loggers. Using loggers it is possible to selectively control which log

 statements are output at arbitrary granularity.

 .

 Log4j can output to: a file, a rolling file, a database with a JDBC driver,

 many output  asynchronously, a JMS Topic, a swing based logging console,

 the NT event log, /dev/null, a SMTP server (using javamail), a socket server,

 syslog, telnet daemon and stdout.

 .

 The format of the output can be defined using one of the various layout

 (or user defined layout) like: simple text, html, date, pattern defined and

 XML.

Description: converts plain array images into multi-size representation
 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.

 .

 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts them to a multi-size representation.

 .

 Following is a list of features:

 .

   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard

   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out later without any further processing

   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in successive steps without wasting computational time

   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be less connected, or more rigid, or both

   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)

   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process as the parent image

   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by selecting among different energy gradient functions

   * Reports progress through a customizable interface

   * A signalling system permits to cleanly handle errors

 .

 The library implements the algorithm described in the paper "Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir, which can be found at http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf

Description: MPEG1 and MPEG2 video decoder library
 libmpeg2 is a library which can decode MPEG1 and MPEG2 video streams.

 .

 The main features in libmpeg2 are:

 .

 * Conformance - libmpeg2 is able to decode all mpeg streams that conform to

   certain restrictions. For streams that follow these restrictions, libmpeg2

   is probably 100% conformant to the mpeg standards - and there's a pretty

   extensive test suite to check this.

 * Speed - there has been huge efforts there, and libmpeg2 is probably the

   fastest library around for what it does.

 * Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when platform-specific

   optimizations are used, there always is a generic C routine to fall back

   on.  This should be portable to all architectures - at least we have heard

   reports from people running this code on x86, ppc, sparc, arm and sh4.

 * Reuseability - libmpeg2 is not intended to include any project-specific

   code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very

   diverse projects.

 This package contains the libmpeg2 shared libraries.

 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems which are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16 and FAT32), ReiserFS (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap. Parted can also detect and remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS, UFS (Sun and HP), XFS and ASFS/AFFS/APFS (Amiga) filesystems, but cannot create, resize or check these filesystems yet.

 .

 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment, they could exist, so please back up all important files before running it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: Audio sample rate conversion library
 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.

 .

 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided; SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.

 .

 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two unlocked sample rates.

 architectural components originally developed to improve the security

 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide

 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access

 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type

 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.

 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set

 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy

 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux

 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary

 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older

 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

 TinyXML2 is a simple and small C++ XML parser that can be easily integrating

 into other programs. It reads XML and creates C++ objects representing the XML

 document. The objects can be manipulated, changed, and saved again as XML.

 .

 TinyXML2 supersedes the previous TinyXML library, with various improvements:

  - Fewer memory allocations (1% - 10% compared to TinyXML)

  - Uses less memory (about 40% of that used by TinyXML)

  - Faster

  - No STL requirement

  - More modern C++, including a proper namespace

  - Proper and useful handling of whitespace

 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol, designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over Xlib:

 .

  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint

  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later

  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol

  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking

  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from

  * eXtensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 Second Edition Recommendation

  * Namespaces in XML Recommendation

  * Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core, Events, and Traversal and

    Range Recommendations

  * Simple API for XML (SAX) 2.0.1 Core and Extension

  * Java APIs for XML Processing (JAXP) 1.2.01

  * XML Schema 1.0 Structures and Datatypes Recommendations

  * Experimental implementation of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3

    Core and Load/Save Working Drafts

  * Provides a partial implementation of the XML Inclusions (XInclude) W3C

    Candidate Recommendation

 .

 Xerces is now able to parse documents written according to the XML 1.1

 Candidate Recommendation, except that it does not yet provide an option to

 enable normalization checking as described in section 2.13 of this

 specification. It also handles namespaces according to the  XML Namespaces 1.1

 Candidate Recommendation, and will correctly serialize XML 1.1 documents if

 the DOM level 3 load/save API's are in use.

Description: XML utilities
 XML is a metalanguage to let you design your own markup language.  A regular markup language defines a way to describe information in a certain class of documents (eg HTML). XML lets you define your own customized markup languages for many classes of document. It can do this because it's written in SGML, the international standard metalanguage for markup languages.

 .

 This package provides xmllint, a tool for validating and reformatting XML documents, and xmlcatalog, a tool to parse and manipulate XML or SGML catalog files.

Description: Music Player Daemon
 Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows remote access for playing audio files (Ogg-Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Wave, and AIFF), streams (Ogg-Vorbis, MP3) and managing playlists. Gapless playback, buffered output, and crossfading support is also included. The design focus is on integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides control for music playback over a TCP/IP network. The goals are to be easy to install and use, to have minimal resource requirements (it has been reported to run fine on a Pentium 75), and to remain stable and flexible.

 .

 The daemon is controlled through a client which need not run on the same computer mpd runs on. The separate client and server design allows users to choose a user interface that best suites their tastes independently of the underlying daemon (this package) which actually plays music.

Description: low level cryptographic library (binary tools)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or

 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,

 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel

 space.

 .

 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic

 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a

 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle

 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the

 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and

 in any way it needs.

 .

 This package contains binary utilities that accompany the library:

 .

    - nettle-lfib-stream - generates a pseudorandom stream, using the Knuth

      lfib (non-cryptographic) pseudorandom generator.

    - sexp-conv - conversion tool for handling the different flavours of sexp

      syntax.

    - pkcs1-conv - converts PKCS#1 keys to sexp format.

 OpenEXR's features include:

    * Higher dynamic range and colour precision than existing 8- and 10-bit image file formats.

    * Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format.

    * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on images with film grain.

    * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR applications.

 .

 This package contains documentation for the format and the following tools:

    * exrheader, a utility for dumping header information.

    * exrstdattr, a utility for modifying OpenEXR standard attributes.

    * exrmaketiled, for generating tiled and rip/mipmapped images.

    * exrenvmap, for creating OpenEXR environment maps.

    * exrmakepreview, for creating preview images for OpenEXR files.

Description: The GNU Parted disk partition resizing program
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package contains the Parted binary and manual page.

 .

 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems which are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16 and FAT32), ReiserFS (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap. Parted can also detect and remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS, UFS (Sun and HP), XFS and ASFS/AFFS/APFS (Amiga) filesystems, but cannot create, resize or check these filesystems yet.

 .

 Note that ReiserFS support is only enabled if you install the libreiserfs0.3-0 package. Since libreiserfs0.3-0 has been removed from sarge, ReiserFS support is not compiled in the default package.

 .

 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment, they could exist, so please back up all important files before running it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web using http(s) and ftp, the two most widely used Internet protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in the background, after having logged off. The program supports recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.

 .

 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically retrieve the new version if it has.

 .

 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load, speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 This package provides the xzdec and lzmadec utilities, which write the decompressed version of a compressed file to standard output. The binaries are very small, so they can be easily stored on small media with some compressed files, and they are linked statically against liblzma so they can be used on machines without a compatible version of liblzma installed. However, they have:

   * no compression support;
