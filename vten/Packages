Description: Java based build tool like make - optional libraries
 Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive

 processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent

 upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the build of Java applications.

 Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks allowing to compile, assemble, test

 and run Java applications. Ant can also be used effectively to build non Java

 applications, for instance C or C++ applications. More generally, Ant can be

 used to pilot any type of process which can be described in terms of targets

 and tasks.

 .

 This package contains the optional tasks libraries.

Description: A tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from files called `Makefile.am'.

 .

 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back of the Automake maintainer).

 .

 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions (with rules being thrown in occasionally). The generated `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.

 .

 Automake 1.11 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 did, so has been renamed so that the previous version can continue to be made available.

 This package provides an interface similar to cpio(1), but using libarchive as the backend for the archiving and extraction of data.  It can read CPIO, tar, pax, zip, jar, ar, and ISO9660 images and provides similar features to the bsdtar package.  Features include:

 .

  * Automatic format detection. Libarchive automatically detects the compression (none/gzip/bzip2) and format (old tar, ustar, gnutar, pax, cpio, iso9660, zip) when reading archives. It does this for any data source.

 .

  * Pax Interchange Format Support. This is a POSIX/SUSv3 extension to the old "ustar" tar format that adds arbitrary extended attributes to each entry. Does everything that GNU tar format does, only better.

 .

  * Handles file flags, ACLs, arbitrary pathnames, etc. Pax interchange format supports key/value attributes using an easily-extensible technique. Arbitrary pathnames, group names, user names, file sizes are part of the POSIX standard; libarchive extends this with support for file flags, ACLs, and arbitrary device numbers.

 .

  * GNU tar support. Libarchive reads most GNU tar archives. If there is demand, this can be improved further.

Description: High-quality block-sorting file compressor - utilities
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression.

 .

 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

 .

 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its predecessor, bzip (.bz).

 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the command line or in scripts. Even if you don't want to use it, other packages on your system probably will.

 .

 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west". GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to look at every character. The result is typically many times faster than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing will run more slowly, however.)

Description: Single library to read/write tar, cpio, pax, zip, iso9660, etc.
 The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and

 writing streaming archive files such as tar and cpio.  The library is

 inherently stream-oriented; readers serially iterate through the archive,

 writers serially add things to the archive.  In particular, note that

 there is no built-in support for random access nor for in-place

 modification.

 .

 libarchive can read at least five tar formats, four cpio formats,

 ISO9660 CD/DVD images (including RockRidge extensions), and ZIP

 files.

 .

 libarchive can write two tar formats (ustar and pax), one cpio format

 (odc/POSIX), and two types of shar files (with and without uuencoding).

 .

 The bsdtar Debian package, which is the default tar(1) on FreeBSD,

 is built using libarchive.

 .

 There is also a manpage, tar(5), that provides an excellent description

 of the various tar file formats.

Description: Java bytecode manipulation framework
 It can be used to dynamically generate stub classes or other proxy classes,

 directly in binary form, or to dynamically modify classes at load time, i.e.,

 just before they are loaded into the Java Virtual Machine.

 .

 ASM offers similar functionalities as BCEL or SERP, but is much smaller

 (25KB instead of 350KB for BCEL and 150KB for SERP) and faster

 than these tools (the overhead of a load time class transformation is on

 the order of 60% with ASM, 700% or more with BCEL, and 1100% or more with

 SERP). ASM was designed to be used in a dynamic and static way and was

 therefore designed and implemented to be as small and as fast as possible.

 The Byte Code Engineering Library is intended to give users a convenient

 possibility to analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files

 (those ending with .class). Classes are represented by objects which contain

 all the symbolic information of the given class: methods, fields and byte

 code instructions, in particular.

 .

 Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed by a program

 (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to a file again. An even more

 interesting application is the creation of classes from scratch at run-time.

 The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be also useful if you want to

 learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class

 files.

Description: atomic data types, operations, and memory ordering constraints
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.

 .

 Boost.Atomic is a library that provides atomic data types and

 operations on these data types, as well as memory ordering

 constraints required for coordinating multiple threads through atomic

 variables. It implements the interface as defined by the C++11

 standard, but makes this feature available for platforms lacking

 system/compiler support for this particular C++11 feature.

 .

 Users of this library should already be familiar with concurrency in

 general, as well as elementary concepts such as "mutual exclusion".

 .

 The implementation makes use of processor-specific instructions where

 possible (via inline assembler, platform libraries or compiler

 intrinsics), and falls back to "emulating" atomic operations through

 locking.

Description: atomic data types, operations, and memory ordering constraints
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.

 .

 Boost.Atomic is a library that provides atomic data types and

 operations on these data types, as well as memory ordering

 constraints required for coordinating multiple threads through atomic

 variables. It implements the interface as defined by the C++11

 standard, but makes this feature available for platforms lacking

 system/compiler support for this particular C++11 feature.

 .

 Users of this library should already be familiar with concurrency in

 general, as well as elementary concepts such as "mutual exclusion".

 .

 The implementation makes use of processor-specific instructions where

 possible (via inline assembler, platform libraries or compiler

 intrinsics), and falls back to "emulating" atomic operations through

 locking.

 Boost.Container is a foundational library that provides a sort of

 cooperative multitasking on a single thread. By providing an

 abstraction of the current execution state in the current thread,

 including the stack (with local variables) and stack pointer, all

Description: provides a sort of cooperative multitasking on a single thread
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.

 .

 Boost.Coroutine provides templates for generalized subroutines which

 allow multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at

 certain locations. It preserves the local state of execution and

 allows re-entering subroutines more than once (useful if state must

 be kept across function calls).

 .

 Coroutines can be viewed as a language-level construct providing a

 special kind of control flow.

 .

 In contrast to threads, which are pre-emptive, coroutine switches are

 cooperative (programmer controls when a switch will happen). The

 kernel is not involved in the coroutine switches.

 .

 The implementation uses Boost.Context for context switching.

 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often

 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix

 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each

 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++

 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular

 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not

 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope

 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a

 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C

 libraries can not do.

Description: Bean Scripting Framework to support scripting languages in Java
 Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides

 scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java

 objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write JSPs in

 languages other than Java while providing access to the Java class library. In

 addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in part (or

 dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. This is

 achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language engines

 from within Java, as well as an object registry that exposes Java objects to

 these scripting language engines.

 .

 BSF supports these scripting languages:

  * Python (using Jython)

  * JavaScript (using rhino)

  * XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and Xerces)

  * BeanShell (using bsh) via its own bsf adapter

 .

 Support for Tcl, NetRexx is not available in this Debian

 package since Jacl, NetRexx (non-free) are not packaged.

 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression.

 .

 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

 .

 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: The Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render Extension.

 .

 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of PDF 1.4.

 .

Description: internet protocol suite Java library
 This is an Internet protocol suite Java library originally developed by

 ORO, Inc. This version supports Finger, Whois, TFTP, Telnet, POP3, FTP,

 NNTP, SMTP, and some miscellaneous protocols like Time and Echo as well

 as BSD R command support. The purpose of the library is to provide

 fundamental protocol access, not higher-level abstractions. Therefore,

 some of the design violates object-oriented design principles. Our

 philosophy is to make the global functionality of a protocal accesible

 (e.g., TFTP send file and receive file) when possible, but also provide

 access to the fundamental protocols where applicable so that the

 programmer may construct his own custom implementations (e.g, the TFTP

 packet classes and the TFTP packet send and receive methods are

 exposed). NetComponents was originally a commercial product, but after

 ORO dissolved, it was continued to be made available for those who

 found it useful. However, no updates have been made since version

 1.3.8, released in 1998. Now that certain contract obligations have

 expired, it is possible to make the source code freely available under

 the Apache Software License.

Description: Asynchronous event notification library (extra)
 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a

 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs

 on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.

 .

 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in

 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,

 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).

 .

 The libevent_extra library includes code for HTTP, DNS, RPC, and so

 on.

 .

 If you're writing software that uses libevent's protocol support, you

 need to link libevent_core and libevent_extra as well.

Description: Java library for loading native libraries without writing JNI code
 Java Native Runtime (JNR) is a collection of Java libraries to make

 interfacing with OS-level features easier. JNR uses an alternate

 method to JNI or JNA to achieve programming simplicity while still

 retaining performance.

 .

 The jnr-ffi package is a set of abstractions that build on the lower-level

 libraries implemented by the jffi package. jnr-ffi allows one to load

 native libraries without writing JNI code by hand, or using tools

 such as SWIG.

Description: Pure java x86 and x86_64 assembler
 This is a pure-java port of asmjit.

 .

 AsmJit is complete x86/x64 JIT-Assembler for C++ language. It supports

 32/64-bit x86 processors including all usable extensions (FPU, MMX, 3dNow, SSE,

 SSE2, SSE3 and SSE4) through type-safe API that mimics Intel assembler syntax

 and eliminates nearly all common mistakes that can be done by developers.

 .

 AsmJit contains also high-level code generation classes that can be used as a

 portable way to create JIT code that should run on all supported architectures.

 High-level classes can handle various function calling-conventions, register

 allocation and 32/64-bit mode differences.

 .

 AsmJit has been successfully tested by various C++ compilers (including MSVC,

 GCC and BorlandC++) under all major operating systems (including Windows, Linux

 and MacOS). AsmJit has been also ported to other programming languages

 including Java, Delphi and Smalltalk (although these ports are not official

 part of AsmJit and was developed outside).

 log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of

 output targets.

 .

 It is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application

 binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements can remain in

 shipped code without incurring a high performance cost.

 .

 One of the distinctive features of log4j is the notion of hierarchical

 loggers. Using loggers it is possible to selectively control which log

 statements are output at arbitrary granularity.

 .

 Log4j can output to: a file, a rolling file, a database with a JDBC driver,

 many output  asynchronously, a JMS Topic, a swing based logging console,

 the NT event log, /dev/null, a SMTP server (using javamail), a socket server,

 syslog, telnet daemon and stdout.

 .

 The format of the output can be defined using one of the various layout

 (or user defined layout) like: simple text, html, date, pattern defined and

 XML.

 XML is a metalanguage to let you design your own markup language.  A regular markup language defines a way to describe information in a certain class of documents (eg HTML). XML lets you define your own customized markup languages for many classes of document. It can do this because it's written in SGML, the international standard metalanguage for markup languages.

 .

 This package provides xmllint, a tool for validating and reformatting XML documents, and xmlcatalog, a tool to parse and manipulate XML or SGML catalog files.

Description: Music Player Daemon
 Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows remote access for playing audio files (Ogg-Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Wave, and AIFF), streams (Ogg-Vorbis, MP3) and managing playlists. Gapless playback, buffered output, and crossfading support is also included. The design focus is on integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides control for music playback over a TCP/IP network. The goals are to be easy to install and use, to have minimal resource requirements (it has been reported to run fine on a Pentium 75), and to remain stable and flexible.

 .

 The daemon is controlled through a client which need not run on the same computer mpd runs on. The separate client and server design allows users to choose a user interface that best suites their tastes independently of the underlying daemon (this package) which actually plays music.

 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the

 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and

 in any way it needs.

 .

 This package contains binary utilities that accompany the library:

 .

    - nettle-lfib-stream - generates a pseudorandom stream, using the Knuth

      lfib (non-cryptographic) pseudorandom generator.

    - sexp-conv - conversion tool for handling the different flavours of sexp

      syntax.

It also provides a process for end-users to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials (typically, a username and password pair), using user-agent redirections.

 .

 OAuth is a service that is complementary to, and therefore distinct from, OpenID. OAuth is also distinct from OATH, which is a reference architecture for authentication (i.e. not a standard).

 .

 This package provides the Python 2.7 module.

Priority: optional
Description: inject useful and sensible default behaviors into setuptools - Python 2.x
 PBR (Python Build Reasonableness) is a library that injects some useful and

 sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run. PBR can:

  * Manage version number based on git revisions and tags (Version file).

  * Generate AUTHORS file from git log

  * Generate ChangeLog from git log

  * Generate Sphinx autodoc stub files for your whole module

  * Store your dependencies in a pip requirements file

  * Use your README file as a long_description

  * Smartly find packages under your root package

 .

 PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way

 to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's

 simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've

 already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need

 PBR.

 .

 PBR builds on top of the work that d2to1 started to provide for declarative

 configuration. d2to1 is itself an implementation of the ideas behind

 distutils2. Although distutils2 is now abandoned in favor of work towards PEP

 426 and Metadata 2.0, declarative config is still a great idea and

 specifically important in trying to distribute setup code as a library when

 that library itself will alter how the setup is processed. As Metadata 2.0 and

 other modern Python packaging PEPs come out, PBR aims to support them as

 quickly as possible.

 .

 This package provides support for Python 2.x.

 TwoLAME is an optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 encoder. It is based on tooLAME by

 Mike Cheng, which in turn is based upon the ISO dist10 code and portions of

 LAME.

 .

 Because of patent issues surrounding the MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3) encoders,

 the ability of most MPEG Audio players to play layer 2 files, and the

 similarity in command-line syntax and API, TwoLAME makes a very good

 drop-in replacement for LAME or other layer 3 encoders.

 .

 This package contains the command line frontend encoder.

Priority: optional
Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web using http(s) and ftp, the two most widely used Internet protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in the background, after having logged off. The program supports recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.

 .

 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically retrieve the new version if it has.

 .

 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load, speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.

 .

 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma package.

 .

 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some improvements for general use:

 .

  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;

  * crc64 data integrity check;

  * limited random-access reading support;

  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);

  * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities - tiny decompressors
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.

 .

 This package provides the xzdec and lzmadec utilities, which write the decompressed version of a compressed file to standard output. The binaries are very small, so they can be easily stored on small media with some compressed files, and they are linked statically against liblzma so they can be used on machines without a compatible version of liblzma installed. However, they have:

 .

   * no compression support;

   * no support for writing to a file other than standard output;

   * no translated messages;

   * been optimized for size rather than speed.

 .

 For a full-featured xzcat command without these limitations, use the xz-utils package instead.
