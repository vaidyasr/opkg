 This package provides an interface similar to cpio(1), but using libarchive as the backend for the archiving and extraction of data.  It can read CPIO, tar, pax, zip, jar, ar, and ISO9660 images and provides similar features to the bsdtar package.  Features include:

 .

  * Automatic format detection. Libarchive automatically detects the compression (none/gzip/bzip2) and format (old tar, ustar, gnutar, pax, cpio, iso9660, zip) when reading archives. It does this for any data source.

 .

  * Pax Interchange Format Support. This is a POSIX/SUSv3 extension to the old "ustar" tar format that adds arbitrary extended attributes to each entry. Does everything that GNU tar format does, only better.

 .

  * Handles file flags, ACLs, arbitrary pathnames, etc. Pax interchange format supports key/value attributes using an easily-extensible technique. Arbitrary pathnames, group names, user names, file sizes are part of the POSIX standard; libarchive extends this with support for file flags, ACLs, and arbitrary device numbers.

 .

  * GNU tar support. Libarchive reads most GNU tar archives. If there is demand, this can be improved further.

 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression.

 .

 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

 .

 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its predecessor, bzip (.bz).

 CELT stands for "Code-Excited Lapped Transform". It applies some of the CELP

 principles, but does everything in the frequency domain, which removes some of

 the limitations of CELP. CELT is suitable for both speech and music and

 currently features:

 .

  * Ultra-low latency (typically from 3 to 9 ms)

  * Full audio bandwidth (44.1 kHz and 48 kHz)

  * Stereo support

  * Packet loss concealment

  * Constant bit-rates from 32 kbps to 128 kbps and above

  * A fixed-point version of the encoder and decoder

 .

 The CELT codec is meant to close the gap between Vorbis and Speex for

 applications where both high quality audio and low delay are desired.

 .

 This package provides the celtenc and celtdec command line tools for encoding

 and decoding.

Priority: optional
Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.

 .

 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file in two directories. `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where two files differ. `cmp' can also show all the characters that differ between the two files, side by side. `diff3' shows differences among three files. `sdiff' merges two files interactively.

 .

 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people. This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared to the complete files. Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Priority: optional
Description: A Perl client and daemon for distributed audio encoding
 The distmp3 package contains a client, distmp3, and a daemon, distmp3host,

 which can be installed on many machines to provide fast distributed encoding

 of music (typically from a CD-ripper or batch script) using an encoder of

 your choice - usually MP3, Ogg Vorbis, or flac.

 .

 abcde is one such CD ripper wrapper which has builtin support for distmp3 and

 can use it very efficiently, especially in the case where the machine with the

 best CD-ROM drive is unable to encode the extracted audio at a satisfactory

 speed.

 .

 The current tradeoff is that the client may not pass command-line arguments to

 the encoder being run on the machines running the distmp3hosts.

Description: GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.

 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.

 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant

 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC2440.

 .

 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to

 the version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes

 with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop

 environments, but also with less dependencies.

 .

 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support

 HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use

 the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.

 .

 GnuPG does not use any patented algorithms. This means it cannot be

 compatible with PGP2, because that uses IDEA (which is patented in

 a number of countries).

 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the command line or in scripts. Even if you don't want to use it, other packages on your system probably will.

 .

 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west". GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to look at every character. The result is typically many times faster than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing will run more slowly, however.)

 Lftp is a file retrieving tool that supports FTP, HTTP, FISH, SFTP, HTTPS and FTPS protocols under both IPv4 and IPv6. Lftp has an amazing set of features, while preserving its interface as simple and easy as possible.

 .

 The main two advantages over other ftp clients are reliability and ability to perform tasks in background. It will reconnect and reget the file being transferred if the connection broke. You can start a transfer in background and continue browsing on the ftp site. It does this all in one process. When you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers. It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a file as soon as possible by using several connections at the same time.

 .

 Lftp can also be scriptable, it can be used to mirror sites, it lets you copy files among remote servers (even between FTP and HTTP). It has an extensive online help. It supports bookmarks, and connecting to several ftp/http sites at the same time.

 .

 This package also includes lftpget - A simple non-interactive tool for downloading files.

Description: Java bytecode manipulation framework
 ASM is an all purpose Java bytecode manipulation and analysis framework.

 It can be used to modify existing classes or dynamically generate classes,

 directly in binary form. Provided common transformations and analysis

 algorithms allow one to easily assemble custom complex transformations

 and code analysis tools.

 .

 ASM offer similar functionality as other bytecode frameworks, but it is

 focused on simplicity of use and performance. Because it was designed and

 implemented to be as small and as fast as possible, it makes it very

 attractive for using in dynamic systems.

Description: Java bytecode manipulation framework
 It can be used to dynamically generate stub classes or other proxy classes,

 directly in binary form, or to dynamically modify classes at load time, i.e.,

 just before they are loaded into the Java Virtual Machine.

 .

 ASM offers similar functionalities as BCEL or SERP, but is much smaller

 (25KB instead of 350KB for BCEL and 150KB for SERP) and faster

 than these tools (the overhead of a load time class transformation is on

 the order of 60% with ASM, 700% or more with BCEL, and 1100% or more with

 SERP). ASM was designed to be used in a dynamic and static way and was

 therefore designed and implemented to be as small and as fast as possible.

Description: Analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files
 The Byte Code Engineering Library is intended to give users a convenient

 possibility to analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files

 (those ending with .class). Classes are represented by objects which contain

 all the symbolic information of the given class: methods, fields and byte

 code instructions, in particular.

 .

 Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed by a program

 (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to a file again. An even more

 interesting application is the creation of classes from scratch at run-time.

 The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be also useful if you want to

 learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class

 files.

 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.

 .

 Boost.Atomic is a library that provides atomic data types and

 operations on these data types, as well as memory ordering

 constraints required for coordinating multiple threads through atomic

 variables. It implements the interface as defined by the C++11

 standard, but makes this feature available for platforms lacking

 system/compiler support for this particular C++11 feature.

 .

 Users of this library should already be familiar with concurrency in

 general, as well as elementary concepts such as "mutual exclusion".

 .

 The implementation makes use of processor-specific instructions where

 possible (via inline assembler, platform libraries or compiler

 intrinsics), and falls back to "emulating" atomic operations through

 locking.

 Boost.Container is a foundational library that provides a sort of

 cooperative multitasking on a single thread. By providing an

 abstraction of the current execution state in the current thread,

 including the stack (with local variables) and stack pointer, all

 registers and CPU flags, and the instruction pointer, a fcontext_t

 instance represents a specific point in the application's execution

 path. This is useful for building higher-level abstractions, like

 coroutines, cooperative threads (userland threads) or an equivalent

 to C# keyword yield in C++.

 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.

 .

 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often

 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix

 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each

 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++

 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular

 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not

 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope

 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a

 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C

 libraries can not do.

Description: Bean Scripting Framework to support scripting languages in Java
 Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides

 scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java

 objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write JSPs in

 languages other than Java while providing access to the Java class library. In

 addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in part (or

 dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. This is

 achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language engines

 from within Java, as well as an object registry that exposes Java objects to

 these scripting language engines.

 .

 BSF supports these scripting languages:

  * Python (using Jython)

  * JavaScript (using rhino)

  * XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and Xerces)

  * BeanShell (using bsh) via its own bsf adapter

Description: The CELT codec runtime library
 CELT is an experimental audio codec for use in low-delay communication.

 .

 CELT stands for "Code-Excited Lapped Transform". It applies some of the CELP

 principles, but does everything in the frequency domain, which removes some of

 the limitations of CELP. CELT is suitable for both speech and music and

 currently features:

 .

  * Ultra-low latency (typically from 3 to 9 ms)

  * Full audio bandwidth (44.1 kHz and 48 kHz)

  * Stereo support

  * Packet loss concealment

  * Constant bit-rates from 32 kbps to 128 kbps and above

  * A fixed-point version of the encoder and decoder

 .

 The CELT codec is meant to close the gap between Vorbis and Speex for

 applications where both high quality audio and low delay are desired.

 .

 This package provides the celt runtime library.

 fundamental protocol access, not higher-level abstractions. Therefore,

 some of the design violates object-oriented design principles. Our

 philosophy is to make the global functionality of a protocal accesible

 (e.g., TFTP send file and receive file) when possible, but also provide

 access to the fundamental protocols where applicable so that the

 programmer may construct his own custom implementations (e.g, the TFTP

 packet classes and the TFTP packet send and receive methods are

 exposed). NetComponents was originally a commercial product, but after

 ORO dissolved, it was continued to be made available for those who

 found it useful. However, no updates have been made since version

 1.3.8, released in 1998. Now that certain contract obligations have

 expired, it is possible to make the source code freely available under

 the Apache Software License.

Description: a generic Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) parsing and manipulation toolkit
 Services provided by Libcroco

 .

  * A parser module that provides

    o A SAC like API. SAC stands for Simple API for CSS. SAC is an event driven

      API wich resembles SAX in the xml world.

    o A CSSOM like API. CSSOM stands for Cascading Style Sheet Object Model.

    The libcroco parser implements the CSS Level 2 specification, the CSS

    forward compatibility rules and the CSS cascading rules.

  * A CSS2 selection engine

    Given an xml element node (that obviously comes from an xml document) and

    a stylesheet cascade, the Libcroco selection engine can evaluate the css

    selectors of the cascade and return the style properties associated to

    the xml element node.

    Note that the xml manipulation toolkit used by the libcroco selection

    engine at the moment is libxml2.

Description: low level cryptographic library (public-key cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or

 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,

 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel

 space.

 .

 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic

 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a

 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle

 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the

 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and

 in any way it needs.

 This library is an implementation of IEC 61883, part 1 (CIP, plug

 61883 protocols.

 .

 The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV,

 MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and

 transmission. It uses the new "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which

 transparently provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also

 represents the third generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for

 these media types thereby removing the complexities of additional kernel

 modules, /dev nodes, and procfs. It also consolidates features for plug

 control registers and connection management that previously existed in

 experimental form in an unreleased version of libavc1394.

 log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of

 output targets.

 .

 It is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application

 binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements can remain in

 shipped code without incurring a high performance cost.

 .

 One of the distinctive features of log4j is the notion of hierarchical

 loggers. Using loggers it is possible to selectively control which log

 statements are output at arbitrary granularity.

 .

 Log4j can output to: a file, a rolling file, a database with a JDBC driver,

 many output  asynchronously, a JMS Topic, a swing based logging console,

 the NT event log, /dev/null, a SMTP server (using javamail), a socket server,

 syslog, telnet daemon and stdout.

 .

 The format of the output can be defined using one of the various layout

 (or user defined layout) like: simple text, html, date, pattern defined and

 XML.

Description: converts plain array images into multi-size representation
 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.

 .

 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts them to a multi-size representation.

 .

 Following is a list of features:

 .

   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard

   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out later without any further processing

   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in successive steps without wasting computational time

   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be less connected, or more rigid, or both

   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)

   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process as the parent image

   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by selecting among different energy gradient functions

   * Reports progress through a customizable interface

   * A signalling system permits to cleanly handle errors

 .

 The library implements the algorithm described in the paper "Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir, which can be found at http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf

 libMirage is a CD-ROM image access library. It is written in C and based on GLib. It's aim is to provide uniform access to the data stored in various image formats.

 .

  * Written in C, based on GLib and its technologies, such as GObject and GModule. 

  * Disc layout representation via GObject-based objects representing disc, session, track, language, index, etc.

  * Support for both CD-ROM and DVD-ROM images

  * CD-TEXT, ISRC, MCN and DVD-ROM disc structures support

  * Capable of generating information not provided by image file; for instance, if image provides only user data, sync pattern, header, ECC/EDC codes and subchannel are generated on fly when they are attempted to be accessed.

  * Currently supported image formats:

    * B6T: BlindWrite 5/6 file format

    * C2D: WinOnCD file format

    * CCD: CloneCD image format

    * CDI: DiscJuggler file format

    * CIF: Easy CD Creator format

    * CUE: CDRwin CUE/BIN image format

    * DAA: PowerISO direct access archives (unencrypted)

    * ISO: Classic ISO9660 image format

    * MDS: Alcohol 120% image format

    * NRG: Nero Burning ROM image format

    * TOC: Cdrdao's TOC/BIN image format

Priority: optional
Description: MPEG1 and MPEG2 video decoder library
 libmpeg2 is a library which can decode MPEG1 and MPEG2 video streams.

 .

 The main features in libmpeg2 are:

 .

 * Conformance - libmpeg2 is able to decode all mpeg streams that conform to

   certain restrictions. For streams that follow these restrictions, libmpeg2

   is probably 100% conformant to the mpeg standards - and there's a pretty

   extensive test suite to check this.

 * Speed - there has been huge efforts there, and libmpeg2 is probably the

   fastest library around for what it does.

 * Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when platform-specific

   optimizations are used, there always is a generic C routine to fall back

   on.  This should be portable to all architectures - at least we have heard

   reports from people running this code on x86, ppc, sparc, arm and sh4.

 * Reuseability - libmpeg2 is not intended to include any project-specific

   code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very

   diverse projects.

 This package contains the libmpeg2 shared libraries.

Priority: optional
Description: Audio sample rate conversion library
 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.

 .

 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided; SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.

 .

 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two unlocked sample rates.

  * Automatically caches connections

  * SSL Support using GnuTLS

  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling

  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication

  * eXtensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 Second Edition Recommendation

  * Namespaces in XML Recommendation

  * Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core, Events, and Traversal and

    Range Recommendations

  * Simple API for XML (SAX) 2.0.1 Core and Extension

  * Java APIs for XML Processing (JAXP) 1.2.01

  * XML Schema 1.0 Structures and Datatypes Recommendations

  * Experimental implementation of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3

    Core and Load/Save Working Drafts

  * Provides a partial implementation of the XML Inclusions (XInclude) W3C

    Candidate Recommendation

 .

 Xerces is now able to parse documents written according to the XML 1.1

 Candidate Recommendation, except that it does not yet provide an option to

 enable normalization checking as described in section 2.13 of this

 specification. It also handles namespaces according to the  XML Namespaces 1.1

 Candidate Recommendation, and will correctly serialize XML 1.1 documents if

 the DOM level 3 load/save API's are in use.

Description: Lossless mp3 normalizer with statistical analysis
 MP3Gain analyzes and adjusts mp3 files so that they have the same volume.

 MP3Gain does not just do peak normalization, as many normalizers do. Instead,

 it does some statistical analysis (using the replaygain algorithm) to

 determine how loud the file actually sounds to the human ear.

 .

 MP3Gain can adjust the volume in a completely lossless way by modifying the

 mp3 file directly, without decoding and re-encoding. This works with all mp3

 players, i.e. no support for a special tag is required.

 .

 MP3Gain can also add replaygain compatible (APE) or ID3v2 gain tags to

 mp3 files.

Description: Music Player Daemon
 Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows remote access for playing audio files (Ogg-Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Wave, and AIFF), streams (Ogg-Vorbis, MP3) and managing playlists. Gapless playback, buffered output, and crossfading support is also included. The design focus is on integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides control for music playback over a TCP/IP network. The goals are to be easy to install and use, to have minimal resource requirements (it has been reported to run fine on a Pentium 75), and to remain stable and flexible.

 .

 The daemon is controlled through a client which need not run on the same computer mpd runs on. The separate client and server design allows users to choose a user interface that best suites their tastes independently of the underlying daemon (this package) which actually plays music.

Description: low level cryptographic library (binary tools)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or

 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,

 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel

 space.

 .

 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic

 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a

 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle

 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the

 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and

 in any way it needs.

 .

 This package contains binary utilities that accompany the library:

 .

    - nettle-lfib-stream - generates a pseudorandom stream, using the Knuth

      lfib (non-cryptographic) pseudorandom generator.

    - sexp-conv - conversion tool for handling the different flavours of sexp

      syntax.

Description: ML implementation with a class-based object system (no X)
 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.

 .

 OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly, generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation: almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.

 .

 The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. It is not available on all arches though.

 .

 This package contains everything needed to develop OCaml applications that do not require the graphics library.

 formats currently supported are RTF, HTML, MIF, JadeTeX, or an XML

 representation of the flow object tree.  Using its own non-standard

 system, it is also capable of transforming one SGML or XML DTD to

 another.

 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package contains the Parted binary and manual page.

 .

 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems which are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16 and FAT32), ReiserFS (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap. Parted can also detect and remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS, UFS (Sun and HP), XFS and ASFS/AFFS/APFS (Amiga) filesystems, but cannot create, resize or check these filesystems yet.

 .

 Note that ReiserFS support is only enabled if you install the libreiserfs0.3-0 package. Since libreiserfs0.3-0 has been removed from sarge, ReiserFS support is not compiled in the default package.

 .

 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment, they could exist, so please back up all important files before running it, and do so at your own risk.

 Partition Image is a partition imaging utility. It has support for the following file systems:

 . 

  * Ext2/3, the Linux standard

  * ReiserFS, a journalised and powerful file system

  * FAT16/32, DOS and Windows file systems

  * HPFS, IBM OS/2 file system

  * JFS, journalised file system, from IBM, used on AIX

  * XFS, another journalised and efficient file system, from SGI, used on Irix

  * UFS (beta), Unix file system

  * HFS (beta), MacOS File system

  * NTFS (experimental), Windows NT, 2000 and XP

 Only used blocks are copied and stored into an image file. The image file can be compressed in the GZIP/BZIP2 formats to save disk space, and split into multiple files to be copied onto removable media (ZIP for example), burned on a CD-R, etc.

 This makes it possible to save a full Linux/Windows system with a single operation. In case of a problem (virus, crash, error, etc.), you just have to restore, and after several minutes, your entire system is restored (boot, files, etc.), and fully working.

 . 

 This is very useful when installing the same software on many machines: just install one of them, create an image, and restore the image on all other machines.

 Shishi currently supports AS/TGS exchanges for acquiring tickets, the

 AP exchange for performing client and server authentication, and

 SAFE/PRIV for integrity/privacy protected application data exchanges.

 .

 Shishi is internationalized; error and status messages can be

 translated into the users' language; user name and passwords can be

 converted into any available character set (normally including

 ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8) and also be processed using an experimental

 Stringprep profile.

 .

 Most, if not all, of the widely used encryption and checksum types

 are supported, such as ARCFOUR, 3DES, AES and HMAC-SHA1.

 .

 This package includes a few command line tools:

  shishi -- Acquire and manage Kerberos tickets.

  keytab2shishi -- Convert MIT/Heimdal /etc/krb5.keytab's to Shishi format.

  ccache2shishi -- Convert MIT/Heimdal user ticket files to Shishi format.

Description: standalone JavaScript/ECMAScript (ECMA-262) interpreter
 SpiderMonkey is a standalone JavaScript/ECMAScript interpreter. It can either take input from files or from a command line driven interface. It is not recommended for production use, as it contains dangerous (security-wise) debugging features.

 .

 ECMAScript (ECMA-262) is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn the language. Language constructs, such as if statements, for and while loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same as these languages (or nearly so).

 .

 JavaScript is a superset of the ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ECMAScript) standard first introduced by Netscape and now led by the Mozilla project.

Description: virtual tunnel over TCP/IP networks
 VTun is the easiest way to create virtual tunnels over TCP/IP networks with traffic shaping and compression.

 .

 It supports IP, PPP, SLIP, Ethernet and other tunnel types.

 .

 VTun is easily and highly configurable, it can be used for various network tasks.

 .

 VTun requires the universal TUN/TAP kernel module which can be found at http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/index.html or in the 2.4 and newer Linux kernels.

 .

 Note: This program includes an "encryption" feature intended to protect the tunneled data as it travels across the network. However, the protocol it uses is known to be very insecure, and you should not rely on it to deter anyone but a casual eavesdropper. See the included README.Encryption file for more information.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web using http(s) and ftp, the two most widely used Internet protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in the background, after having logged off. The program supports recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.

 .

 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically retrieve the new version if it has.

 .

 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load, speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol

  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking

  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from

    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

 .

 This package provides the xzdec and lzmadec utilities, which write the decompressed version of a compressed file to standard output. The binaries are very small, so they can be easily stored on small media with some compressed files, and they are linked statically against liblzma so they can be used on machines without a compatible version of liblzma installed. However, they have:

 .

   * no compression support;

   * no support for writing to a file other than standard output;

   * no translated messages;

   * been optimized for size rather than speed.
